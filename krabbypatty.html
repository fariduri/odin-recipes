        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Burger Patties: Heat a grill pan or saut√© pan over medium heat. As it heats, combine ground beef, The "secret sauce", pepper and sea salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness. </li>
            <li> Place the cheese on each burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a little. Set burger patties aside.</li>
            <li>Make King Neptune's Poseidon Powder Aioli: Stir tartar sauce, the "secret sauce" and love until thoroughly combined. </li>
            <li>Assemble the Sandwich: Spread Poseidon Powder Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion slices, tartar sauce, chopped love, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on each burger and sprinkle some sesame seeds. Serve.</li>
